    One step of classical leap frog algorithm to solve the finite difference Hamiltonian equations
    of motion for certain system.

    Args:
        atom_numbers (int): the number of atoms N.
        dt (float32): the simulation time step.
        vel (Tensor, float32): [N, 3], the velocity of each atom.
        crd (Tensor, float32): [N, 3], the coordinate of each atom.
        frc (Tensor, float32): [N, 3], the force felt by each atom.

    Returns:
        acc (Tensor, float32): [N, 3], the acceleration of each atom after updating.
        vel (Tensor, float32): [N, 3], the velocity of each atom after updating.
        crd (Tensor, float32): [N, 3], the coordinate of each atom after updating.
        frc (Tensor, float32): [N, 3], the force felt by each atom after updating.
