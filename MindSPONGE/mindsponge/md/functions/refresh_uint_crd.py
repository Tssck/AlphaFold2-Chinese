    Refresh the unsigned coordinate of each constrained atom in each constrain iteration.

    Args:
        half_exp_gamma_plus_half (float32): constant value (1.0 + exp(gamma * dt)) if Langvin-Liu thermostat is used,
        where gamma is friction coefficient and dt is the simulation time step, 1.0 otherwise.
        crd(Tensor, float32): [N, 3], the coordinate of each atom.
        quarter_cof (Tensor, float32): [3,], the coefficient mapping coordinates to uint coordinates.
        test_frc(Tensor, float32): [N, 3], the constraint force.
        mass_inverse(Tensor, float32): [N, ], the inverse value of mass of each atom.

    Outputs:
        uint_crd(Tensor, uint32): [N, 3], the unsigned int coordinate value of each atom.
