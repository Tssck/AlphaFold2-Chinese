    Calculate the Coulumb energy of the system using PME method.

    .. math::

        E = sum_{ij} q_iq_j/r_{ij}

    Args:
        atom_numbers (int): the number of atoms, N.
        beta (float): the PME beta parameter, determined by the
                       non-bond cutoff value and simulation precision tolerance.
        fftx (int): the number of points for Fourier transform in dimension X.
        ffty (int): the number of points for Fourier transform in dimension Y.
        fftz (int): the number of points for Fourier transform in dimension Z.
        uint_crd (Tensor, uint32): [N, 3], the unsigned int coordinates value of each atom.
        charge (Tensor, float32): [N,], the charge carried by each atom.
        nl_numbers - (Tensor, int32): [N,], the each atom.
        nl_serial - (Tensor, int32): [N, 800], the neighbor list of each atom, the max number is 800.
        scaler (Tensor, float32): [3,], the scale factor between real space
          coordinates and its unsigned int value.
        excluded_list (Tensor, int32):[E,] containing the CSR format column indices of excluded atom.
          E is the number of excluded atoms.
        atom_excluded_index (Tensor, int32):[E,] containing the row indices corresponding excluded_list,
        i.e. each CSR format row index is replicated to map to one CSR format column index.
        neutralizing_factor -(Tensor, float32): [1, ] the factor parameter to be updated in pressure calculation.

    Outputs:
        reciprocal_ene  (float) - the reciprocal term of PME energy.
        self_ene (float) - the self term of PME energy.
        direct_ene (float) - the direct term of PME energy.
        correction_ene (float) - the correction term of PME energy.
