    One step of classical leap frog algorithm to solve the finite difference
    Hamiltonian equations of motion for certain system, using Langevin dynamics
    with Liu's thermostat scheme. Assume the number of atoms is N and the target
    control temperature is T.

    Detailed iteration formula can be found in this paper: A unified thermostat
    scheme for efficient configurational sampling for classical/quantum canonical
    ensembles via molecular dynamics. DOI: 10.1063/1.4991621.

    Args:
        atom_numbers (int): the number of atoms N.
        half_dt (float): half of time step for finite difference.
        dt (float): time step for finite difference.
        exp_gamma (float): parameter in Liu's dynamic, equals
            exp (-gamma_ln * dt), where gamma_ln is the firction factor in Langvin
            dynamics.
        inverse_mass (Tensor, float32): [N,], the inverse value of
            mass of each atom.
        sqrt_mass_inverse (Tensor, float32): [N,], the inverse square root value
            of effect mass in Liu's dynamics of each atom.
        velocity (Tensor, float32): [N, 3], the velocity of each atom.
        crd (Tensor, float32): [N, 3], the coordinate of each atom.
        frc (Tensor, float32): [N, 3], the force felt by each atom.
        acc (Tensor, float32): [N, 3], the acceleration of each atom.
        max_vel (flaot32): the max velocity of each atom.

    Outputs:
        velocity (float)
        updated_crd (float)
        acc (float)
        frc (float)
