    Refresh the coordinate and velocity of each constrained atom after all iterations have ended.

    Args:
        dt_inverse (float32): the inverse value of simulation time step.
        exp_gamma (float32): constant value exp(gamma * dt).
        half_exp_gamma_plus_half (float32): constant value 1.0 + exp(gamma)/2
        crd (Tensor, float32): [N, 3], the coordinate of each atom.
        vel (Tensor, float32): [N, 3], the velocity of each atom.
        test_frc(Tensor, float32): [N, 3], the constraint force.
        mass_inverse(Tensor, float32): [N, ], the inverse value of mass of each atom.

    Returns:
        crd_lin (Tensor, float32): [N, 3], the coordinate of each atom after updating.
        vel_lin (Tensor, float32): [N, 3], the velocity of each atom after updating.
